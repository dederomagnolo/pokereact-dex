# pokereact-dex

This is a personal project to understand the basics of an apollo server and graphQL inside a react application. In this project I used the open pokemon API https://pokeapi.co/ to get all pokemon images and pokemon data. The semantic UI framework is used to styles (https://semantic-ui.com/).

All you need to know about creating an apollo server from the scrath you found here: 
https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/

To build this project you need to:

1) clone the project folder.
2) Run yarn install for the both applications (apollo-server and reactdex-pokedex)
3) In the apollo-server path you need to run "node index.js" to start locally your apollo server.
4) In the reactdex-pokedex path you need to run "npm start" to build the react application in the default localhost 3000.
5) Have fun!
